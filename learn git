u-untracked
a- added or staged

command we need to know:
git status -s = to know current status of the unstaged and staged file
git log --oneline = to know the current status of saved points
.gitignore=> if we have to ignore some files and saying the GitHub to not to 
track the file then we create the .gitignore file and write the file name inside 
the .gitignore file.
